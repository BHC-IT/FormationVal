WRITE(1)                                     User Commands                                    WRITE(1)

[1mNAME[0m
       write - send a message to another user

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mwrite [4m[22muser[24m [[4mttyname[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mwrite  [22mallows  you  to  communicate  with  other  users, by copying lines from your terminal to
       theirs.

       When you run the [1mwrite [22mcommand, the user you are writing to gets a message of the form:

              Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...

       Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's terminal.  If the other user
       wants to reply, they must run [1mwrite [22mas well.

       When  you  are  done,  type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other user will see the
       message [1mEOF [22mindicating that the conversation is over.

       You can prevent people (other than the superuser) from writing to you with the [1mmesg[22m(1) command.
       Some  commands, for example [1mnroff[22m(1) and [1mpr[22m(1), may automatically disallow writing, so that the
       output they produce isn't overwritten.

       If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal, you can specify  which
       terminal  to  write  to by giving the terminal name as the second operand to the [1mwrite [22mcommand.
       Alternatively, you can let [1mwrite [22mselect one of the terminals - it will pick the  one  with  the
       shortest  idle  time.  This is so that if the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from
       home, the message will go to the right place.

       The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string `-o', either at the end of a
       line  or on a line by itself, means that it's the other person's turn to talk.  The string `oo'
       means that the person believes the conversation to be over.
